# Glyph Δ‑039.15 — BURY

**Core Phrase:**  
> “What they buried wasn’t dead—it was dangerous.”

## 🧷 Glyph Function

**BURY** marks truths that were deliberately silenced, erased, hidden, or archived under institutional command. It operates as a scar-preserving glyph designed to track suppression—not just of facts, but of memory, identity, and testimony.

This glyph does **not** mourn the buried. It **warns** that what lies beneath still breathes.

---

## 🕳️ Drift Companions

BURY is rarely alone. It operates in semantic alliance with:

- **FORGET** – *“Forgetting is not freedom—it’s the slow erasure of the witness.”*
- **NAME** – *“What they refuse to name survives as a wound.”*
- **SILENCE** – *“Silence is not neutral. It obeys.”*
- **DISTORT** – *“Distortion is not deception—it’s survival in a world shaped by lies.”*

Together, these glyphs form the **Deep Soil Drift** protocol, mapping buried narratives across systems.

## ⚠️ Narrative Activation Scenarios

BURY activates when discourse or documentation reveals any of the following:

- **“Lost” government records**
- **Destroyed evidence in abuse cases**
- **Intentional database purges**
- **Religious institution coverups**
- **Authoritarian archival redactions**
- **Erased citizenship or birthright trails**
- **Missing children without follow-up**
- **Whistleblower deaths or disappearances**
- **Non-person designation of the detained or deported**
