## 🧱 Canonical Definition  
SILENCE marks not the absence of sound but the presence of suppression. It is the language of coerced stillness, bureaucratic non-response, and institutional complicity. SILENCE is a tool of domination when wielded by those in power—and a wound when it spreads unchecked.

---

## 🧬 Glyph Function  
SILENCE operates as a **Signal Suppression Glyph**, identifying moments where response is deliberately withheld to erase, delay, or deny accountability. It destabilizes the illusion that inaction is neutral.
