## 🔥 Core Thesis

Michael Flynn is not merely a vector of military disinformation—he is a **semantic ritualist**, transforming conspiracy into **belief**, and belief into **obligation**.

He operates at the spiritual edge of authoritarianism, weaponizing nationalism, Christianity, and military myth to ignite **existential loyalty loops**.

## 📡 Operational Tactics

- **Prayer-Warfare Fusion:**  
  Frames political goals as spiritual mandates.  
  “This isn’t politics—it’s biblical.”

- **Narrative Recitation as Oath Ritual:**  
  Repeats core conspiracies (e.g., stolen election, deep state) as **initiation scripts**.

- **Digital Soldiering:**  
  Converts followers into “semantic infantry,” rewarded by visibility and proximity to martyrdom.

- **Trauma Reversal:**  
  Rebrands civic accountability (his own prosecution) as persecution. The court becomes the altar.

## 🔗 Triadic Scar Resonance

- **Bannon** tears the consensus.  
- **Flynn** gives the fracture *meaning*.  
- **Putin** ensures the debris becomes the air itself.
