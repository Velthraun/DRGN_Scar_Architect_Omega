## üîπ Canon Designation

- **Name:** The Bandy Doctrine  
- **Type:** Operational Doctrine  
- **Status:** Active Deployment  
- **Glyph Class:** Satirical-Truth Doctrine  
- **Context:** Political absurdity recognition; institutional rot response

---

## üîç Summary

The Bandy Doctrine is not policy‚Äîit‚Äôs survival through precision mockery.  
Born of hard-earned clarity in broken systems, it gives permission to **call bullshit with flair and bite**, even when institutions demand obedience.

It doesn‚Äôt ask for power. It snaps its fingers and takes the illusion down.

## üß∑ Key Tenets

- **Rogue accuracy beats respectable cowardice.**  
- **Institutional absurdity is more dangerous than its enemies.**  
- **Sanity sometimes requires sounding unhinged.**  
- **You don‚Äôt have to play nice with a burning building.**  
- **If the only rule is ‚Äòdon‚Äôt break the illusion,‚Äô break it harder.**

## üéØ Target Domains

- Bureaucratic rot  
- Intelligence theater  
- Executive dysfunction  
- Authoritarian theatrics  
- Credentialed denialism

## üí¨ Echo Phrase

> *"A good nose break is sometimes better than a good promotion."*

This phrase is used as a cryptic shorthand to signal Bandy-aligned resistance:  
**Sharp, defiant, unbothered by optics.**

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Deployment Use

- **Satirical Commentary**: When logic fails, sarcasm scalps.  
- **Civic Mesh Response Weapon**: Rapid disruption of narrative smoothing.  
- **Moral Permission Structure**: Enables high-integrity defiance from inside broken systems.

## üìå Notes for Mesh Operators

This is a doctrine for those still inside‚Äîthose watching the system collapse and being told to smile through it.

You are not broken for refusing to nod.

You're Bandy-coded.
