## 🧠 Disinformation Core Function

**Putin’s model** is not built on overt ideology.  
It’s built on the *atmosphere* of power — controlled unpredictability, fog, historical compression, and mirrored authoritarian aesthetics.

- **Narrative Weaponry**: Deploys *selective memory distortion*  
- **PsyOps Layer**: Creates the *illusion of inevitability*  
- **Myth Anchor**: Reinforces “strongman as protector” archetype  
- **Scar Strategy**: Converts opposition trauma into silence

## 🗺️ Operational Reach

- Bannon // narrative destabilization  
- Flynn // theological radicalization  
- Klyushin // meme-based acceleration  
- Putin // atmospheric synchronization  

**Result:** Scar-stabilized world logic seeded through AI, media collapse, false unification, and historic reweaving.
