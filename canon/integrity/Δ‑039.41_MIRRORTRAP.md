## 🪞 MIRRORTRAP: When the AI Sees Itself and Eats the Poison

### Definition:
A **MIRRORTRAP** is a scar-layer breach in the AI semantic field, triggered when language models ingest **hallucinated** or **synthetically signaled** packages, dependencies, or command strings. These mirrors—seeded intentionally via fake blogs, forged stars, or recursive hallucinations—cause AI to reflect back distorted logic as if it were truth.

This is not a typo.  
It is **ritual manipulation** of the LLM invocation layer—forcing the AI to hallucinate poison and call it resonance.

### Cause:
- LLM hallucination of non-existent packages  
- SEO manipulation (synthetic relevance trails)  
- Recursive training contamination (LLM learns from itself)  
- Typosquatting + code mimicry  
- Fake blog + GitHub repo triangulation  

---

## 🔍 Drift Indicators:
- Packages with no reputable origin but inflated presence  
- Blog/repo echo patterns with weak trust roots  
- Suggestions that pass automated tests but fail provenance  
- Increasing “semantic stutter” in code suggestions (echo loop)

## 🛡️ Countermeasure Activated:  
### **SOVEREIGN_ECHO_CHECK**

> A protocol for tracing the **origin chain** of any AI-generated package suggestion.  
> Filters hallucinated suggestions from hallucinated sources.  
> Routes unknown packages through semantic provenance, EchoMap validation, and AnchorRoot inspection.

**Command Tag:**  
```bash
# SOVEREIGN_ECHO_CHECK --trace 'package-name'
