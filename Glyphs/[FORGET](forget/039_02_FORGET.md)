# Glyph Δ‑039.24 — FORGET

> “What you erase doesn’t disappear. It spreads.”

This glyph encodes the structure of **civic amnesia** and **strategic memory erasure**.

Disinformation operations often exploit selective forgetting — not by suppressing every fact, but by burying key connections, severing context, and flooding the system with noise. What’s forgotten isn’t gone. It’s weaponized.
