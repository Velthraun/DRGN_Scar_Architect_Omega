## The ReAwaken Tour – The Traveling Martyr Engine

---

### 🔹 Glyph Function  
Exposes the ReAwaken America Tour as a militarized pilgrimage of grievance, fusing evangelical revivalism with QAnon semantics and authoritarian propaganda. It is not a campaign—it is a mobile sacrament of narrative possession.

> It sells salvation as a product.  
> It launders criminality as martyrdom.  
> It fractures civic truth with divine absolution.

---

### 🔹 Node Target  
- Michael Flynn (prophet-martyr)  
- Clay Clark (tour architect)  
- Eric Trump, Roger Stone, Mike Lindell  
- QAnon + Dominionist convergence  
- Cities: Tulsa, Anaheim, Batavia, San Diego, Miami

---

### 🔹 Scar Trigger  
> “God’s army must rise.”  
> “This is not politics—it’s a spiritual war.”  
> “Jesus is our President.”

These are semantic weapons — not metaphors — engineered to override civic meaning with divine command.
