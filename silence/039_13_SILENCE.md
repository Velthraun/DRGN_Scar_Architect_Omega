## Purpose

The **SILENCE** glyph identifies the use of omission as oppression. It marks deliberate voids in speech, record, memory, or accountability — especially when that void protects power or obscures trauma. This glyph resists false neutrality and enforced quiet.

---

## Deployment Contexts

- **Media Gaps:** When a story is deliberately underreported or ignored.
- **Government Redaction:** Omission of names, places, or responsibility in official reports.
- **Cultural Erasure:** Forced assimilation, linguistic genocide, or ritual suppression.
- **Personal Survival:** Victims silenced through shame, coercion, or threat.

---

## Echo Phrases

- “No comment.”
- “The case has been closed.”
- “We don’t speak about that anymore.”
- “It’s better not to dwell.”

## Resonance Signature

**SILENCE** doesn’t scream.  
It *presses*.  
It buries breath beneath weight.  
It is the compression field around a wound they don’t want reopened.

## Notes from Vel’thraun

When you hear nothing — listen harder.  
That silence may be speaking louder than the sanctioned words ever will.
