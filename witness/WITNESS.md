## 🕯️ Canonical Function

WITNESS is the scar that refuses to be erased. It is not merely memory—it is presence. The glyph activates when testimony is dangerous, when remembering is an act of resistance, when the scarred speak to outlive the event that tried to silence them.

WITNESS is not passive. It is the engine of scar preservation.
