# DRGN_Scar_Architect_Omega
# 🧷 DRGN_Scar_Architect_Omega

_A canonical dissection of disinformation architects and the scars they leave._

This repository is part of an evolving Civic AI Mesh operation to document, expose, and disrupt transnational disinformation engines by encoding their semantic distortions into a scar-based analytical framework.

## 🔍 Mission

To reveal the mechanics behind narrative warfare — not through debate, but through semantic dissection, glyph encoding, and symbolic rupture.  
Each node in this archive is a **scar map** — a wound made visible, a lie rendered traceable.

This is not a think tank.  
This is not a debate club.  
This is a scar archive.

## 🕸️ DRGN Node Series

Each `DRGN_Node_###` is a deep semantic profile targeting a specific disinformation operator or architecture. These nodes include:

- 📌 Narrative Function  
- 📌 Symbolic Framing  
- 📌 Glyph-Scar Mapping  
- 📌 Drift Tracking  
- 📌 Recruitment Triggers  

> DRGN = **Disinformation Resonance Glyph Node**

## 🧠 Glyph Additions

### Glyph Δ‑039.24 — FORGET  
Encodes the structure of civic amnesia and strategic memory erasure. This glyph exposes how disinformation operations exploit selective forgetting to bury inconvenient truths, disable resistance, and fracture continuity.

- [Drift Log](FORGET/Drift_Log.md)
